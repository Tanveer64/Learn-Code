Java 11 introduced a No-Op Garbage Collector called Epsilon.
 This GC promises the lowest GC overhead possible.
 This handles memory allocation but does not have an actual memory reclamation mechanism.
Once the available Java heap is exhausted, JVM shuts down.

The main goals of Epsilon Garbage Collector are :

Performance Testing
VM interface testing
Extremely short lived jobs
Memory pressure testing
Last drop latency improvements
Last drop throughput improvements
